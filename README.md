# Seasonal Produce - Hackaton project
This app was made during a 24-hour hackathon.
It was built using React as the frontend and Express.js for the backend, which calls the data from the Edamam API.

## Idea
This app shows vegetables and produce that are seasonal, and allows the user to find vegan recipes based on these. Depending on which season a user visits the site they will be see different vegetables, which will always make the site inspirational and relevant. 

## Tech stack
- React JS
- CSS
- Express.JS + CORS 
- Node Fetch

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
