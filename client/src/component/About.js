            <h3>What Is Local Food and Why Should You Care?</h3>
            <p>
                There’s no formal definition of the term local food. But one common definition of “local” food is food grown within 100 miles of its point of sale or consumption.
                But it’s up to you to decide what buying local food means to you. Maybe it means foods grown and produced in your state or your region. Or maybe it means that it comes from farmers you know and can talk to — for example, at a farmer’s market or through a CSA. And for some people, “local” is more about the values of small-scale and community-based than about a specific geographic configuration.
                More and more people want to know where their food comes from and the farming practices of the farmers that grow and produce it. And this is important for many reasons:
                It helps you develop a connection with food.
                You become more aware of what you’re putting in your body.
                You vote every time you shop, and with knowledge comes the ability to support foods and growers you believe in.
